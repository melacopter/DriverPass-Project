# DriverPass-Project
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The DriverPass project was given by the owner of the company, Liam, who sought out our company to help him create a system capable of supporting his business online. Specifically, the system was designed to enable students to purchase the packages offered by DriverPass in order to pass their driving tests. The system was to be supported on a browser and hosted on a cloud-based server.

What did you do particularly well?
  I believe the models I created were particularly well done and that they are the strongest aspect of my presentation. I had a thorough understanding of the system and the design concepts behind each model.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  If I were to alter one part of my documents, it would be the class diagram featured in the system design document. I would add more information regarding the relationships and interactions between the different classes. For example, when considering the relationship between the drivers, cars and appointments, I would specify that the appointment class tracks the assignment of both drivers and cars, and the car and driver classes track each other's assignments as well.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
 It is important to consider the needs of each user during the design process in order to ensure that all functionality requirements are met. In the DriverPass project, there were many different needs for each user and not every user should have the same permissions for the sake of security. In order to meet these needs, I designed the system to have different types of users, each requiring a unique username and password, so each user could accomplish their task without compromising any sensitive company data.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  When considering the design of the system's software, I considered the functionality required by the client. Specifically, the owner of DriverPass wanted to be able to access the database while he was not in the office, so that influenced the decision to have the system be operable on a browser via a cloud-based server. I would consider using this same strategy in the future, and I would also utilize the creation of a requirements outline as demonstrated in the business requirements document.
